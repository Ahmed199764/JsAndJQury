## How JS makes web pages more interactive
You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
* Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
* Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
* Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of ema i 1 
  
REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:
* A button is pressed
* A link is clicked (or tapped) on
* A cursor hovers over an element
* Information is added to a form
* An interval of time has passed
* A web page has finished loading

## EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER 
1. Access the content of the page
2. Modify the content of the page
3. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
4. React to events triggered by the user or browser

### EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 
* EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
* EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 

### OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
